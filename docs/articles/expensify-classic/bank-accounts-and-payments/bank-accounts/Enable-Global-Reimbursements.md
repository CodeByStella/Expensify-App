# FAQ

## Can multiple people send reimbursements internationally?
Yes. Once a bank account is verified, the person who connected it can share access with other admins in the workspace.

## How long does verification take?
It typically takes a few business days, but can extend to several weeks depending on compliance review.

## Why can't my employee add a non-USD bank account?
Check that their default workspace matches the one connected to the reimbursement bank account.

## Who is the “Authorized User” on the DocuSign form?
This is the person who processes international reimbursements and should be the same person who connects the bank account in Expensify.

## Does Expensify support SEPA in the EU?
Yes. Expensify supports **SEPA B2B**. **SEPA Core is not supported**.
